### Process

I used the following steps to create this project:

1. Installed the latest [KMP plugin](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2025/05/kotlin-multiplatform-tooling-now-in-intellij-idea-and-android-studio/) and used the New Project Wizard to generate the project with non-shared UI.

2. Prompted [ChatGPT with the assignment description verbatim](https://chatgpt.com/share/68370524-7670-800a-8a3f-c26303ed857e) and added the generated classes.
3. Refactored the ChatGPT generated `ProductListViewModel.swift` with `ProductListViewModel.kt` as we should be sharing view models to stay DRY.
4. Replaced the `@Published var products: [Product] = []` property wrapper in `ProductListViewModel.swift` with a `val products: StateFlow<List<Product>>` in  `ProductListViewModel.kt` to expose the state of the model.
5. Added [Skie](https://skie.touchlab.co) to the project for improved Swift interop and used the [support for observing Flows in SwiftUI views](https://skie.touchlab.co/features/flows-in-swiftui) to consume the products state flow from SwiftUI in `ContentView.swift`
6. Removed the trivial sorting generated by ChatGPT with dynamic sorting logic defined in `ProductListViewModel.kt` to demonstrate flow reactivity updating the UI.
7. Added a picker to the UI to control the selected sort order and binded the two-way mutable state flow `sortBy` via a `@State` property.

### What next

If I were to continue to develop this assignment, my next step would be to add error handling for the loading of the product data by notifying the user and a retry/refresh mechanism to reattempt the request.
